# MaxSubArraySum
Its a new problem of array.


Problem:

Given an array of integers, write a function to find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

For example, given the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is [4, -1, 2, 1], and its sum is 6.

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the sum of the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.


Both solutions have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), since they only use a constant amount of additional memory.
